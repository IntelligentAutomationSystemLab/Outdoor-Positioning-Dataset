# Outdoor-Positioning-Dataset
A dataset of outdoor positioning in GPS-denied environments.


Outdoor positioning is a hot and important topic, especially in GPS-denied environments. In this regard, an open data set and guidance document for outdoor positioning based on environmental information are released here. We will continue to improve and launch new data set versions for research purposes. Of course, if you use this dataset for research please consider citing the following papers:

Yu-Sheng Tu, Jhan-Yu Liao, Yu-Sheng Lin, And Shang-Chih Lin+, Shun-Feng Su, and Yennun Huang, "Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm Based on Environmental Information for Outdoor Positioning on Campus," Journal of Information Science and Engineering, Vol. XX No. X, pp. XX-XX, 2024. email: Dr. Lin <sclin@fcu.edu.twâ€‹>

# We expect to make the dataset and paper public in Q1 2024.
